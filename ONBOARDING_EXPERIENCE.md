# Onboarding Experience: Start Your Solarpunk Commune

The app should guide people into building gift economy practices, starting small and expanding naturally. This document describes the AI-guided onboarding flow.

---

## Design Philosophy

**Start where you are.** A commune can be:
- Just you, practicing gift economy with neighbors
- A household of 3 sharing resources
- A friend group coordinating meals
- An apartment building sharing tools
- A neighborhood network
- A full intentional community

The app meets you where you are and helps you grow.

**Progressive disclosure.** Don't show everything at once. Unlock features as they become relevant.

**AI as gentle guide.** The AI isn't a chatbot - it's a thoughtful companion that notices patterns, suggests next steps, and celebrates milestones.

---

## First Launch: "Hello, Let's Begin"

### Screen 1: Welcome

```
Welcome to Solarpunk Mesh

A gift economy starts with a simple question:
What do you have to share?

And another:
What do you need?

Let's set up your commune - it can be as small
as you and one neighbor, or as big as your dreams.

[Let's Begin]
```

### Screen 2: Name Your Commune

```
What shall we call your community?

This can be your household name, your neighborhood,
or anything that feels right. You can change it later.

[_______________________]

Examples:
- "Oak Street Collective"
- "Apartment 4B"
- "The Garden House"
- "Eastside Mutual Aid"

[Continue]
```

### Screen 3: Your Role

```
How would you describe your starting point?

[ ] I'm starting solo - building connections
[ ] I'm in a household - we share already
[ ] I know a few people who want to try this
[ ] I'm joining an existing community

[This helps us customize your experience]

[Continue]
```

### Screen 4: Your First Offer

```
Let's make your first offer to the community.

What's something you have that others might need?
Don't overthink it - start small.

Category: [Food / Tools / Skills / Space / Other]

What is it?
[_______________________]

How much/how often?
[_______________________]

Examples:
- "Extra eggs from my chickens, ~6/week"
- "Drill and basic tools, available to borrow"
- "Can help with computer problems"
- "Backyard space for gatherings"

[Make My First Offer]
```

### Screen 5: Your First Need (Optional)

```
Is there something you need right now?

Asking for what we need is as important as offering.
It creates opportunities for others to give.

[Yes, I have a need] [Skip for now]

---

If yes:

What do you need?
[_______________________]

When do you need it by?
[This week / This month / Ongoing]

[Post My Need]
```

### Screen 6: Invite Others

```
A gift economy grows through connection.

Who else might want to join [Oak Street Collective]?

[Share invite link]
[Enter email addresses]
[Skip - I'll invite people later]

You can always invite more people from Settings.
```

### Screen 7: You're Ready

```
Welcome to [Oak Street Collective]!

Your commune is set up with:
- 1 member (you!)
- 1 offer posted
- Ready to grow

Here's what happens next:
- Check in when you have something to share
- The AI will help match offers with needs
- Celebrate every gift that flows

[Enter Your Commune]
```

## First Week: Gentle Guidance

The app provides daily prompts for the first week. These appear as friendly notifications or in-app cards.

### Day 1: After Setup

```
Welcome to your first day!

Tip: The gift economy works best when it's visible.
Tell one person about your offer today.

[Remind Me Later] [I Did It!]
```

### Day 2: Check Your Inventory

```
Good morning!

Take a quick look around your space.
Is there anything you have extra of?

Common first offers:
- Books you've finished reading
- Kitchen items you rarely use
- Plants or seeds
- Skills you take for granted

[Add Another Offer] [Nothing Right Now]
```

### Day 3: Express a Need

```
Asking is giving too.

When you express a need, you give others
the opportunity to help. That's a gift.

What's one thing that would make your week easier?

[Express a Need] [I'm Good For Now]
```

### Day 4: Invite Someone

```
Gift economies grow through trust.

Think of one person who might appreciate this.
- A neighbor you've chatted with
- A friend who loves sharing
- Someone who's mentioned needing something

[Invite Someone] [Not Yet]
```

### Day 5: Review What's Happening

```
Let's see how [Oak Street Collective] is doing.

[X] offers available
[X] needs expressed
[X] members

Even if the numbers are small, you've started something.
Every commune begins with the first gift.

[See Details]
```

### Day 6: Meet the AI Helpers

```
You have some AI helpers working behind the scenes.

When there are enough offers and needs, they'll suggest:
- Matches (Alice has what Bob needs)
- Batch activities (everyone's tomatoes are ripe!)
- Work parties (let's do this together)

They only make suggestions - you always decide.

[Learn More About Agents] [Got It]
```

### Day 7: First Week Reflection

```
You've completed your first week!

Reflection prompt:
What's one thing that surprised you about
thinking in terms of gifts?

[Share Reflection] [Keep Private] [Skip]

---

Next week, we'll explore:
- Setting up regular sharing rhythms
- Connecting with more neighbors
- Using the AI matchmaker
```

---

## 30-Day Journey: Building Rhythms

After the first week, the app shifts to weekly themes with lighter daily prompts.

### Week 2: "What's Already Flowing"

**Theme**: Notice the gift economy already around you

**Monday**: "What did you share or receive this week - even outside the app?"

**Wednesday**: "Add one 'invisible' gift to your offers - something you do that others might value (watering plants while neighbors travel, checking on elderly folks, etc.)"

**Friday**: "Weekly roundup - celebrate one gift that happened"

**AI Milestone**: If 3+ members, first automated match suggestions appear

### Week 3: "Rhythms of Sharing"

**Theme**: Establish sustainable patterns

**Monday**: "Set up a recurring offer - something you can share regularly (weekly eggs, monthly tool lending, etc.)"

**Wednesday**: "What's your ideal sharing rhythm? Daily check-ins? Weekly? The app adapts to you."

**Friday**: "Invite the AI to suggest a 'sharing schedule' based on your patterns"

**AI Milestone**: Perishables Dispatcher starts monitoring expiring offers

### Week 4: "Growing the Circle"

**Theme**: Expanding thoughtfully

**Monday**: "Who's been curious about your commune? This might be a good week to invite them."

**Wednesday**: "Create a 'welcome gift' - something you offer to every new member"

**Friday**: "Month 1 celebration! Here's what [Oak Street Collective] has shared..."

**AI Milestone**: Work Party Scheduler activates if 5+ members

---

## Ongoing: Seasonal & Contextual Prompts

After 30 days, the app provides contextual guidance based on:

### Seasons

**Spring**: "Seed sharing season! Do you have seeds to offer?"

**Summer**: "Peak produce time. The Perishables Dispatcher is watching for abundance."

**Fall**: "Preservation season. Anyone interested in a canning work party?"

**Winter**: "Gift-giving season. What skills could you teach?"

### Community Milestones

**First match**: "Your first match happened! [Alice] and [Bob] connected through the gift economy."

**10 members**: "You've reached 10 members! Time to think about community rhythms."

**First work party**: "Your first group activity is planned! Here's how to make it great..."

**100 gifts**: "Your commune has facilitated 100 gifts! Here's your impact..."

### Gentle Nudges

**Inactive offer**: "Your [tool lending] offer has been up for 30 days with no takers. Want to refresh it or try something different?"

**No needs posted**: "You haven't expressed a need in a while. Remember: asking is giving."

**Member gone quiet**: "Haven't seen [Bob] in 2 weeks. Want to check in?"

## AI Guide Personality

The AI guide should feel like a wise, warm friend who:

### Speaks Simply
- "What do you have to share?" not "Create a resource listing"
- "The AI helpers found a match" not "The Mutual Aid Matchmaker agent generated a proposal"

### Celebrates Small Things
- "One neighbor helped another. That's what it's all about."
- "You've been sharing for 30 days straight. Consistency builds community."

### Never Pressures
- "Skip for now" is always an option
- "Not yet" is respected
- No guilt trips about engagement

### Offers Wisdom
- "Gift economies are ancient. You're joining a tradition as old as humanity."
- "The best time to share is when you have abundance. The second best time is now."
- "Every commune started with one person deciding to try."

### Acknowledges Reality
- "Some weeks nothing flows. That's okay."
- "Not every match works out. Relationships take time."
- "Growth isn't always more people. Sometimes it's deeper connection."

## Scenarios

### Scenario: Alex in an Apartment

**Week 1**
Alex lives alone in an apartment building. Sets up "Apartment 4B" with one offer: "Can receive packages for neighbors when I'm home."

**Week 2**
Invites neighbor Maria after chatting in the hall. Maria offers "Extra tomatoes from my balcony garden." Alex posts a need: "Could use help moving a bookshelf."

**Week 4**
Maria connects Alex with her friend Chen who has a hand truck. Chen joins the commune. First three-person gift chain!

**Month 3**
"Apartment 4B" has 8 members across 3 buildings. They've shared tools, produce, and skills. The AI suggests a monthly potluck.

### Scenario: Jordan's Household

**Week 1**
Jordan sets up "The Green House" for their 4-person household. Everyone adds offers: communal pantry items, rides to grocery, dog walking.

**Week 2**
The AI notices overlapping grocery trips and suggests a shared list system. The household starts coordinating meals.

**Month 2**
Jordan invites two neighbor households. Now 12 people sharing across 3 homes. Tool sharing explodes - everyone had a drill, now they share one.

**Month 6**
"The Green House" has become "Maple Street Commons" - 25 people, regular work parties, a shared garden plot, and a tool library.

### Scenario: Sam's Existing Community

**Week 1**
Sam's intentional community of 40 people adopts the app. Bulk onboarding - everyone adds offers in a community session.

**Day 3**
200+ offers in the system. The AI is already suggesting matches and noticing patterns. "You have 8 people offering childcare - want to coordinate a schedule?"

**Month 1**
The agents are in full effect: Perishables Dispatcher saves 50 lbs of produce from waste. Work Party Scheduler coordinates 3 garden sessions. Match rate is 85%.

**Month 6**
They connect with two other communes using the mesh network. First inter-commune tool lending. Dreams of regional gift economy.

## Missing Implementation

To make this onboarding real, we need:

### Must Build

1. **Onboarding flow screens** (React components)
   - Welcome sequence
   - First offer/need creation
   - Invite flow

2. **User profiles & auth**
   - Currently no user system
   - Needed for "your offers" vs "community offers"

3. **Community/commune entity**
   - Currently no multi-tenant support
   - Need: community name, settings, membership

4. **Daily prompt system**
   - Background check for relevant prompts
   - In-app notification cards
   - "Mark as done" tracking

5. **Progressive feature unlocking**
   - Track community milestones
   - Show/hide UI based on scale

### Should Build

6. **AI guide persona**
   - Friendly copy throughout app
   - Contextual tips and wisdom
   - Celebration moments

7. **Analytics for guidance**
   - Track what's working
   - Personalize suggestions

8. **Invite system**
   - Shareable links
   - Email invites
   - Join flow for new members

### Nice to Have

9. **Reflection prompts**
   - Weekly questions
   - Community storytelling

10. **Milestone celebrations**
    - Visual celebrations
    - Community achievements

## UI Copy Examples

### Empty States

**No offers yet:**
```
Your offer list is empty.

The gift economy starts with what you have.
What could you share today?

[Add Your First Offer]
```

**No needs yet:**
```
No needs expressed yet.

Asking is a gift too - it creates
opportunity for others to help.

[Express a Need]
```

**No matches yet:**
```
No matches yet - and that's okay.

Matches happen when offers meet needs.
As your community grows, so will connections.

Keep sharing. Keep asking.
```

### Success Moments

**First offer posted:**
```
Your first offer is live!

"[Extra eggs, ~6/week]"

This is now visible to [Oak Street Collective].
When someone needs eggs, they'll find you.
```

**First match:**
```
It happened!

[Alice] had tomatoes. [Bob] needed vegetables.
The gift economy connected them.

This is what it's all about.
```

**Work party completed:**
```
Work party complete!

[Spring Planting] brought together:
- 5 community members
- 4 hours of shared labor
- 20 trees planted

Everyone contributed. Everyone benefited.
This is how commons are built.
```

### Error States

**Offline:**
```
You're offline right now.

That's actually fine - this app is built for
communities that don't always have internet.

Your offers and needs are saved locally.
They'll sync when you're connected again.
```

**Invite failed:**
```
Couldn't send that invite.

Try sharing the link directly instead:
[Copy Link]

Or just tell them in person!
The best invitations are personal anyway.
```

## Questions to Resolve

1. **Identity system**: OAuth? Magic link? Phone number? Local-only initially?

2. **Multi-commune**: Can one person be in multiple communes? (Probably yes - home + neighborhood + work)

3. **Moderation**: What happens with bad actors? Community self-governance?

4. **Data ownership**: Can you export your gift history? Delete your account?

5. **Offline-first onboarding**: How does onboarding work without server connection?
