# Proposal: Knowledge Osmosis

**Status:** DRAFT  
**Philosopher:** Freire (Pedagogy of the Oppressed)

## Problem
Study circles create knowledge but often hoard it. Learning remains private. Wisdom doesn't circulate.

## Solution
When study circles complete their work, they output **artifacts to the Common Heap**:
- Zines synthesizing what they learned
- Guides for others exploring the same topic
- Questions that remain unanswered
- Resources that helped them

The network becomes a learning organism where knowledge osmoses from circle to circle.

## Key Features
- Study circles commit to producing shareable artifacts
- Artifacts tagged by topic, difficulty, language
- Other circles discover and build on previous learning
- Credits the original circle ("Based on learning by Circle 42")
- Knowledge compounds over time

## Success Metric
Every study circle produces at least one artifact that another circle uses.
