# Proposal: Language Justice

**Status:** DRAFT  
**Philosopher:** Gloria Anzaldúa (Borderlands/La Frontera)

## Problem
English-only systems exclude billions of people. Translation is often an afterthought, poorly done, or missing entirely.

## Solution
**Multi-language from the start**:
- UI strings in JSON, not hardcoded
- Community translation system - members can submit translations
- Automated translation with human review
- Language selection: user's choice, auto-detected, or cell default
- Support for right-to-left languages (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.)

## Key Features
- At least Spanish + English at launch (US context)
- Community-driven translation for additional languages
- No "English as default" - equal treatment of all languages
- Cultural adaptation, not just word-for-word translation
- Voice UI supports multiple languages

## Success Metric
>20% of users use the app in a language other than English.
