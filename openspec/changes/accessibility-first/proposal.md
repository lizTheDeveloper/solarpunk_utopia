# Proposal: Accessibility First

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED  
**Philosopher:** Mia Mingus (Disability Justice)

## Problem
Most tech is inaccessible to disabled people. Screen readers break. Buttons are too small. Language is too complex. "Accessible version coming later" never comes.

## Solution
**Accessibility as core constraint, not optional add-on**:
- All UI components tested with screen readers FIRST
- Minimum touch target: 48x48px (Android accessibility standard)
- Plain language: 8th grade reading level
- Voice control: everything works without touch
- High contrast mode: mandatory, not optional

## Key Features
- Accessibility audit required for every feature
- Testing with actual disabled users, not just automated tools
- Alternative interfaces: voice, large print, simplified
- No "accessible version" - ONE version that works for all

## Success Metric
>10% of active users report using accessibility features.
