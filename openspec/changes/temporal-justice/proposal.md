# Proposal: Temporal Justice

**Status:** DRAFT  
**Philosopher:** Silvia Federici (Wages Against Housework)

## Problem
Gift economy assumes everyone has "free time" to give. But caregivers, workers with multiple jobs, single parents - they don't have time to participate. Excluding them based on availability is unjust.

## Solution
**Asynchronous participation modes**:
- "Slow exchange" - matches that can happen over weeks, not days
- "Chunk offers" - "I have 30 min Tuesday, 45 min Friday"
- Time banking integration - acknowledge reproductive labor
- Proposal voting has 7-day windows, not 24-hour deadlines

## Key Features
- Async-first design - participation doesn't require synchronous presence
- Acknowledge care work as contribution
- Flexible deadlines based on member availability
- No penalty for "slow" participation

## Success Metric
>30% of active members have fragmented availability schedules.
