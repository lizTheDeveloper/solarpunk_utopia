# Workshop Sprint Plan

**Mission:** Build resistance infrastructure for 500k+ network
**Timeline:** Weeks, not months
**Resources:** 3 Claude Pro Max accounts + coordination
**Stakes:** The future of distributed resistance in America

---

## The Vision

A mesh network that enables:
1. **Economic withdrawal** from extractive systems ($1B+ redirected annually at scale)
2. **Mutual aid coordination** that works without internet
3. **Sanctuary operations** for people at risk
4. **Rapid response** when the state comes for our people
5. **Resilient community** that can't be shut down

## Critical Reference Documents

Before building ANYTHING, read:

1. **[ARCHITECTURE_CONSTRAINTS.md](ARCHITECTURE_CONSTRAINTS.md)** - Non-negotiable requirements
   - Old phones (Android 8+, 2GB RAM)
   - Fully distributed (no server)
   - Works without internet
   - No big tech dependencies
   - Seizure resistant

2. **[ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW.md](ADVERSARIAL_REVIEW.md)** - How to sabotage this network
   - 40 attack vectors identified
   - Priority hardening items
   - Assume infiltration

---

## Agent Coordination Protocol

When working on these proposals:

1. **Read the proposal completely** before starting
2. **Check for dependencies** - some proposals build on others
3. **Update proposal status** as you work (Draft → In Progress → Implemented)
4. **Document what you build** - others will need to understand
5. **Test on actual Android device** if touching mobile
6. **Think adversarially** - assume infiltrators will try

---

## Emergency Contacts

If stuck, need decisions, or find blocking issues:

- Liz: [coordination channel]
- This repository: main source of truth
- Philosopher Council reviews: for values decisions

---

## Remember

> "Every transaction in the gift economy is a transaction that DIDN'T go to Bezos. Every person connected to the mesh is someone who can't be isolated. Every cell that forms is a community that can protect its own."

This isn't an app. It's infrastructure for the next economy.

Build accordingly.
