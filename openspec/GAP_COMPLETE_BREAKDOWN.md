## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Priority (Before Workshop)
1. ✅ Complete Priority 1 proposals (DONE)
2. ✅ Complete Priority 2 proposals (DONE)
3. **Implement Priority 1 gaps** (critical for demo)

### Medium Term
4. Create Priority 6 proposals (security is critical for production!)
5. Create Priority 3-5 proposals (polish & features)

### Long Term / Philosophical
6. Create Priority 7 proposals (requires deep engagement with political theory)

### Security Warning ⚠️

**Priority 6 gaps are CRITICAL** for any real deployment:
- GAP-41: CORS wide open
- GAP-42: No authentication (overlaps with GAP-02)
- GAP-56: No CSRF protection
- GAP-57: SQL injection risks

**Do NOT deploy to production** without addressing Priority 6 security gaps!

## Proposal Creation Strategy

### Batch 1: Security Essentials (Priority 6, subset)
- GAP-41, GAP-43, GAP-44, GAP-56, GAP-57
- These overlap with GAP-02 (Auth System)

### Batch 2: UX Quick Wins (Priority 3-4, subset)
- GAP-13, GAP-14, GAP-26, GAP-28
- Low effort, high impact

### Batch 3: Operations (Priority 6, subset)
- GAP-48, GAP-50, GAP-52, GAP-54
- Essential for production operations

### Batch 4: Philosophical (Priority 7, all)
- Requires deep analysis and design
- May need consultation with political theorists
- Most radical/innovative gaps
